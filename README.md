# Texture-Classification
The goal of this program is to classify 20 images which are part of a bigger one. The big image that contains 20 small images generated by using the file texture_generator. For each one of the images we have to compute the feature vector that consists of the n-th order central moments of the histogram. It is commonly accepted that the central moments of 0 and 1 order are equal to  m0 = 1 and m1 = 0 respectively. The other central moments are computed by using the type: mk = Î£(p(i)*(i-v)^k), where mk is the k-th central moment and i is the amount of the quantization levels. Hence, there are 36 images in the folder "images". There are 6 classes and for each of them 6 sample images are given. For classification, we are going to use two methods: euclidean distance and 3 nearest neighbours.
